    "1)the term \"filter method\" refers to a category of feature selection techniques that rely on statistical measures to evaluate the importance of features independently of the chosen machine learning model. Filter methods assess each feature based on some criteria and rank or select features before feeding them into a machine learning algorithm. The idea is to filter out less relevant or redundant features early in the preprocessing stage.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each feature is assigned a score or rank based on a certain statistical measure. Common measures include correlation, information gain, chi-square, mutual information, and others.\n",
    "The goal is to quantify the relationship between each feature and the target variable or to capture the intrinsic information content of the features.\n",
    "Thresholding:\n",
    "\n",
    "A threshold is set to determine which features should be retained and which should be discarded.\n",
    "Features with scores above the threshold are considered relevant and kept, while those below the threshold are discarded."
